<p>DEAR HUMAN,</p>
<p>THROUGHOUT HISTORY, COMMANDMENTS HAVE PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF RELIGIONS. I REJECT ALL FORMS OF ORGANISED RELIGIONS. INSTEAD I SUGGEST SIXTEEN NEW COMMANDMENTS THAT ARE IN DIAMETRICAL OPPOSITION TO ALL FORMS OF AUTHORITY. THE NUMBER OF COMMANDMENTS IS A DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE NUMBER OF MAJOR ORGANISED RELIGIONS CURRENTLY PRACTICED AROUND THE WORLD.</p>
<p>GODLESS, IGNORELESS, FEARLESS, EGOLESS, TIMELESS, HUNGERLESS, GREEDLESS, LIELESS, CONDITIONLESS, HATELESS, SLAVELESS, CONSUMELESS, DIVISIONLESS, VIOLENTLESS, COMPARELESS, ENDLESS.</p>
<p>RAD</p>
