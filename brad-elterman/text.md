<p>
SUMMER OF 2016
</p>

<p>
ADVICE TO ANYONE YOUNGER THAN ME
</p>

<p>
DO NOT TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY. YOUR CAREER IS YOUR PASSION. LIVE RECKLESSLY! 
</p>

<p>
ITâ€™S OK TO EMBRACE + SHOOT DIGITAL. MARRIAGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE STATE OF CA IS NOT NECESSARLY PART OF THE PICTURE.
</p>

<p>
TRAVEL THE WORLD AND DO NOT STAY IN HOSTELS. BORROW + SAVE EVERY DIME TO BUY YOUR FIRST HOUSE. NEVER SELL YOUR HOUSE.  IT MAY BE YOUR RETIREMENT 
</p>

<p>
SEND YOUR PHOTOS TO BLOGS ALL OVER THE INTERNET + DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ANYONE STEALING THEM.  EXCHANGE BODILY FLUIDS NOW WHILE YOU CAN, BECAUSE NO ONE WILL LOOK AT YOU AFTER 54.  THERE YOU HAVE IT 
AND HAVE FUN !!
