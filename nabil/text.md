MY RANT

- TO WHOM MIGHT CARE TO READ,
<br>
FIRST APOLOGIES FOR MY TERRIBLE FARKIN HANDWRITING. IM BETTER WITH
PHOTOS,  DO WHAT FEELS RIGHT TO YOU,    USE YOUR INTUITION AND IF YOU
STILL ARE NOT SURE THEN ASK SOMEONE YOU REALLY TRUST. THEN THERE IS NO
REGRETS.       I WAITED 33 YEARS TO TRY MUSHROOMS AND MDMA, I AM GLAD
I DID, WAIT TO TRY, SAVE MONEY, BUT DON'T, WHEN THEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
ENJOY THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR.  LIFE IS TOO SHORT NOT TO ENJOY EVERY
MOMENT. IT'S OK TO LIKE NICE THINGS, BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
A LOGO THEN A FABRIC OR FIT.
IF I COULD SHARE 3 THINGS, ALL THE TOP THAT TOOK ME 34 YEARS ON EARTH
LEANING (MOSTLY THE HARD WAY) IS :
<br>
1 TRAVEL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
<br>
10 MILES TO THE WOODS - 100 TO THE BEACH - OR 7,000 ACROSS EARTH
THE EXPERIENCES OF DIFF CULTURES, SMELLS, TASTES. A GREAT PART OF WHO
I AM RESIDES IN THESE TRAVELS. ESPECIALLY MY ART.
</p>
<p>
2 STRETCH, STRETCH, STRETCH.
<br>
FUCK I WISH I STRETCHED MORE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
BODY AND MIND REALLY GO HAND IN HAND, WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF BECOMING
NUMB TO THE PAIN OR NUMBING IT WITH MEALS. AND DRINK LOTS OF FRESH
GINGER, IT MAKES EVERYTHING FEEL BETTER.
<br>
3 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE BUT BE KIND!!!
<br>
I KNOW I'M NOT THE NICEST PERSON BUT I HAVE KINDNESS IN MY HEART. IT
GOES A LONG WAY.... WE ALL HAVE A VOICE, LETS USE IT TO SHARE
POSITIVITY WITH OTHERS, IF YOU ARE READING THIS ON YOUR COMPUTER THAN
LETS HELP THE 80% WHO DON'T HAVE THIS PRIVILEGE.
