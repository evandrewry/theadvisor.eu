MY RANT
</p>
<p>
- TO WHOM MIGHT CARE TO READ,
<br>
FIRST APOLOGIES FOR MY TERRIBLE FARKIN HANDWRITING. IM BETTER WITH
<br>
PHOTOS,  DO WHAT FEELS RIGHT TO YOU,    USE YOUR INTUITION AND IF YOU
<br>
STILL ARE NOT SURE THEN ASK SOMEONE YOU REALLY TRUST. THEN THERE IS NO
<br>
REGRETS.       I WAITED 33 YEARS TO TRY MUSHROOMS AND MDMA, I AM GLAD
<br>
I DID, WAIT TO TRY, SAVE MONEY, BUT DON'T, WHEN THEN THE TIME IS RIGHT
<br>
ENJOY THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR.  LIFE IS TOO SHORT NOT TO ENJOY EVERY
<br>
MOMENT. IT'S OK TO LIKE NICE THINGS, BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
<br>
A LOGO THEN A FABRIC OR FIT.
<br>
IF I COULD SHARE 3 THINGS, ALL THE TOP THAT TOOK ME 34 YEARS ON EARTH
<br>
LEANING (MOSTLY THE HARD WAY) IS :
<br>
1 TRAVEL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
<br>
 10 MILES TO THE WOODS - 100 TO THE BEACH - OR 7,000 ACROSS EARTH
<br>
THE EXPERIENCES OF DIFF CULTURES, SMELLS, TASTES. A GREAT PART OF WHO
<br>
I AM RESIDES IN THESE TRAVELS. ESPECIALLY MY ART.
</p>
<p>
2 STRETCH, STRETCH, STRETCH.
<br>
FUCK I WISH I STRETCHED MORE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
<br>
BODY AND MIND REALLY GO HAND IN HAND, WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF BECOMING
<br>
NUMB TO THE PAIN OR NUMBING IT WITH MEALS. AND DRINK LOTS OF FRESH
<br>
GINGER, IT MAKES EVERYTHING FEEL BETTER.
<br>
3 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NICE BUT BE KIND!!!
<br>
I KNOW I'M NOT THE NICEST PERSON BUT I HAVE KINDNESS IN MY HEART. IT
<br>
GOES A LONG WAY.... WE ALL HAVE A VOICE, LETS USE IT TO SHARE
<br>
POSITIVITY WITH OTHERS, IF YOU ARE READING THIS ON YOUR COMPUTER THAN
<br>
LETS HELP THE 80% WHO DON'T HAVE THIS PRIVILEGE.
