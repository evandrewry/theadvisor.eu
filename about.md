A MAN’S FIRST REBELLION OCCURS ONCE HE SHEDS CONFINEMENT. EDITED BY ALEX KAZEMI, THE ADVISOR HOSTS A BI-ANNUAL DIGITAL GALLERY OF ORIGINAL HANDWRITTEN LETTERS PENNED BY VENERATED MALES WITHIN THE ARTS, WRITTEN TO FELLOW MEN. THESE ARTIFACTS EXIST AS PILLARS OF ADVICE, MENTORSHIP, AND PERSONAL ANECDOTES, OFFERING A PEEK INTO THE INNER WORLDS OF CULTURE’S MOST PARAMOUNT MALE CREATIVES. BY OFFERING THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND ADVISEMENT IN PURSUITS OF OCCUPATION, LIFE, AND LOVE, THE ADVISOR AIMS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN MYTH AND REALITY, ALLOWING FOR COUNSEL AND GUIDANCE FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL CREATIVE TO THE READER.
