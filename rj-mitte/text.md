NOTE TO SELF:
</p>

<p>
DON’T DWELL ON THE DARKNESS. WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN OUR MINDS WITH THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER. THIS INDUSTRY CAN BE CRUEL AND TAKE ALOT OUT OF YOU. BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU THE HAPPIEST YOU CAN FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH ANY SITUATION.  ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE TIMES AS LIFE LESSONS, YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING. BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PUT YOUR FAITH IN, PEOPLE WILL TRY TO USE YOU TO GET AHEAD. ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION! 
</p>

<p>
BUT ALSO, NEVER BE CLOSED OFF TO THE WORLD AND THE PEOPLE IN IT. YOU HAVE BEEN LUCKY SO FAR, AND DON’T GIVE UP ON THE WORK. AS SOON AS YOU THINK YOU’VE COMPLETED SOMETHING, SOMETHING ELSE HAS ALREADY OPENED UP TO YOU. BE READY FOR ANYTHING AND GOOD LUCK ON THIS JOURNEY.
</p>

<p>
P.S YOU’LL NEED IT!
