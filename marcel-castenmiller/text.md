DEAREST MR. ARMSTRONG,
</p>
<p>
MAYBE I CAN GET THROUGH TO YOU BY MEANS OF MY SELFISH APPROPRIATION OF SKY PHOTOGRAPHS I HAD TAKEN THE DAY I HEARD THE SAD NEWS OF YOUR DEPARTURE. I DOUBT I WILL TRY TO BE AS ARAKI NOBUYOSHI AS THIS AGAIN. NOT SURE IF YOU ARE AWARE BUT I AM WELL... EXCEPT FOR MY ADDICTION TO GIVING MY SOUL TO DESTRUCTIVE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. THE OLDER I GET THE MORE I UNDERSTAND YOUR CYNICISM. EVERYONE IS JUST RUSHING AROUND WITH THEIR GENITALS EXPOSED COUNTING THEIR LAST HOURS. 
<br>
THINKING OF YOU FOREVER.
</p>
<p>
27.3.16
<br>
YOURS, MARCEL CASTENMILLER
