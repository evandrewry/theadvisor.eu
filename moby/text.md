<p>
A LETTER TO ME IN 2066.
</p>

<p>
HI, SO, HOW ARE YOU?
</p>

<p>
ARE YOU (AKA: WE) STILL ALIVE? IS NEW YORK UNDERWATER?
</p>

<p>
DO PEOPLE STILL EAT MEAT? HAVE HUMANS STOPPED KILLING EACH OTHER AND DESTROYING THEIR HOME?
</p>

<p>
WELL, HERE’S HOPING. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE ME,
<br>
AS I WRITE THIS, FIFTY YEARS AGO?
</p>

<p>
I’M ASSUMING SOMETHING LIKE “DON’T BUY COASTAL REAL ESTATE.” AND “FLOSS AND DO YOGA.” ?
</p>

<p>
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS.  DOES IT STILL RAIN IN CALIFORNIA?
</p>

<p>
I HOPE THAT I TREATED YOU/US WELL. I KNOW I’VE TRIED TO. AS I’VE AGED I’VE INCREASINGLY SEEN THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ACTIONS AND CHOICES. SO I’VE TRIED TO BE GOOD TO US. I HOPE THAT THEY HAVEN’T THAT ORGANIC FOOD AND HIKING ARE CARCINOGENS.  THAT WOULD BE IRONIC. WELL, I HOPE YOU’RE HAPPY.
</p>

<p>
I HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL FORESTS.  I HOPE THAT TRUMP WAS NEVER ELECTED PRESIDENT. I HOPE, THAT HUMANS HAVE GROWN UP AND LEARNED HOW TO STOP KILLING THEMSELVES, ANIMALS, AND THE ONLY HOME WE’VE EVER HAD.
</p>

<p>
LOVE, MOBY
</p>

<p>
P.S ARE WE STILL BALD?
</p>
