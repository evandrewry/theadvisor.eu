DEAR FEMME MEN,
</p>
<p>
TO BE VERY HONEST WHEN I WAS ASKED TO WRITE A LETTER TO MEN I WAS PRETTY ANNOYED. WHY DO MEN NEED ANOTHER LETTER, SONG, MOVIE, BOOK, OR TV SHOW WRITTEN TO THEM OR ABOUT THEM? THEY DON’T.  BUT INSTEAD OF GETTING ANGRY I THOUGHT WHY NOT JUST WRITE A LETTER TO FEMME MEN ONLY BECAUSE ME AND FEMME SISTER/BROTHERS COULD USE A LITTLE SHINE.
</p>
<p>
SO... HEY GIRL FUCKING HEY! HOW ARE YOU TODAY? I HOPE YOUR WRISTS ARE LIMP. I HOPE YOUR HAIR IS SNATCHED, I HOPE YOU ARE BOUNCING HIGHER IN THAT WALK, THEN EVER BEFORE, AND I HOPE YOU ARE FEELING EXTRA PROUD OF YOUR FABULOUS VOCAL TONES. I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD A MAJOR YEAR.  I HAVE HAD OVER 9 SONGS IN THE RADIO TOP 40, AND 3 OF THOSE SINGS I CO-WROTE WENT #1 !
</p>
<p>
I’M NOT SAYING THIS TO BRAG, I’M SAYING THIS TO LET YOU KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH OUR OWN COMMUNITY DOESN’T SUPPORT OUR FEMME WAYS THAT WE CAN STILL ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS THAT REACH THE MAINSTREAM. I MEAN I’M BRAGGING A LITTLE AND THAT’S OK. I’M PROUD AND GRATEFUL OF MY SONGS, SHOES, LYRICS, MASCARA, MELODIES, QUEENY ONE­LINERS, AND MY HORRIBLE PENMENSHIP/SPELLING.
</p>
<p>
LAST THING, I HOPE YOU GET LAID AND FALL IN LOVE. I KNOW IT CAN FEEL IMPOSSIBLE WHEN ALL YOU READ + HEAR FROM FELLOW HOMOS IS “NO FEMMES” OR “I’M IN TO MEN SO ACT LIKE ONE!” I KNOW IT STILL GETS TO ME AND I’M 35 ON FIERCE, BUT I HAVE HAD LOVE IN THE PAST AND I HOPE TO AGAIN ONE DAY.
</p>
<p>
XXO, JT
