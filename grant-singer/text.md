<p>
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,
</p>

<p>
THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT IN LIFE THAN TO TRULY EXPERIENCE IT.
<br>
CHALLENGE YOURSELF. EXPERIENCE LOVE AND PAIN AND HOLD ONTO IT. I THINK ALL GREAT ART COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE FOUND SOME SORT OF TRUTH AND THEIR EXPERIENCES HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO CONVEY IT. IF I HAD TO PICK THE FILMMAKERS WHO HAVE INFLUENCED ME THE MOST IT WOULD BE KUBRICK, BERGMAN, HITCHCOCK AND DAVID FINCHER.  WATCH THEIR MOVIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY’VE BEEN CONSTRUCTED.  THEN ONCE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’VE GRASPED THEIR WORK THROW IT ALL ALWAY AND DO YOUR THING. 
</p>

<p>
DON’T LET OTHER PEOPLE’S INSECURITIES BRING YOU DOWN.  THERE WILL BE  ^ LOT OF PEOPLE WHO UNDERESTIMATE YOU BUT JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AND KEEP WORKING AND GETTING BETTER. THE’LL COME AROUND AND YOU’LL HAVE THE LAST LAUGH.
</p>

<p>
DON’T BECOME COMPLACENT. ONCE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MAKING THINGS THAT YOU LIKE KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO A MILLION TIMES BETTER AND DON’T STOP UNTIL YOU DO.
</p>

<p>
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH GOOD PEOPLE AND DON’T TAKE YOURSELF TOO SERIOUSLY.  BE WARY OF PEOPLE THAT DO.
</p>

<p>
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ENJOY YOUR LIFE. IT’S A GIFT.  
</p>

<p>
TO BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE A LIVING DOING WHAT YOU LOVE SHOULDN’T BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED.  BE KIND AND GRATEFUL AND MAKE THINGS THAT ARE UNDENIABLY GREAT.
</p>

<p>
SINCERELY,
</p>
