HEY RICHARD,

I KNOW YOU WON’T LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING. THERE’S NO POINT TRYING TO TELL YOU TO STEP AWAY FROM DRUGS AND THE EASY MONEY YOU’RE GONNA MAKE TARNISHING YOUR NAME BY SHOOTING FOR PORN MAGS. BUT, BRIEFLY YOU WERE JOGGING AND SWIMMING AND LIVING HEALTHY. THE ONE THING I HOPE YOU WILL LISTEN TO IS PLEASE PLEASE BE AWARE OF YOUR POSTURE AND THE WAY YOU STAND AND SIT. THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A HUGE EFFECT ON YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE DOWN THE ROAD. STANDING AROUND HUNCHED OVER WITH YOUR HAIR IN YOUR EYES AND A CIG IN YOUR MOUTH MIGHT LOOK COOL AT 18 BUT YOU ARE GONNA BE SPENDING A FORTUNE IN LATTER LIFE TRYING TO GET YOUR BODY IN SOME KIND OF ALIGNMENT JUST SO YOU CAN WALK WITHOUT PAIN IN YOUR FEET AND LEGS.

OTHER THAN THAT HAVE FUN 

LOVE, ME
